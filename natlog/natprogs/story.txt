ChatGPT wrote this short story, with not more than 10 sentences about Alice and Bob discovering that encrypting messages between them is too much of a pain and not worth doing it as nobody is listening to what they are saying to each other.
Alice and Bob were good friends and enjoyed chatting with each other.
They heard about encryption and decided to try it out to keep their messages secure.
They downloaded a secure messaging app and began to encrypt their conversations, but soon found it to be too much of a hassle.
They had to constantly enter passwords and decipher each other's messages, which made their conversations less enjoyable.
One day, they decided to skip the encryption and just chat freely.
As it turned out, nobody was listening in on their conversations in the first place, so there was no need for encryption.
They laughed about the whole thing and continued to chat without any worries.
From then on, they realized that sometimes it's better to keep things simple and not overcomplicate things.
